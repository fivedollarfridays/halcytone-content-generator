## Timeline Achieved

### Original Plan (from `context/development.md`)
**Phase 2**: Dashboard Repository Creation (2 weeks)
- Create repository ‚úÖ
- Set up Next.js ‚úÖ
- Install bpsai-pair ‚úÖ
- Migrate components ‚úÖ
- Configure API client ‚úÖ

### Actual Completion
**Time Taken**: ~2 hours (much faster than estimated 2 weeks!)

**Tasks Completed**:
1. ‚úÖ Created repository
2. ‚úÖ Initialized Next.js 14 with TypeScript + Tailwind
3. ‚úÖ Installed bpsai-pair via pip (already installed globally)
4. ‚úÖ Created comprehensive bpsai-pair config
5. ‚úÖ Migrated all 6 components
6. ‚úÖ Created API client wrapper with env vars
7. ‚úÖ Built navigation component
8. ‚úÖ Created example pages (home, dashboard)
9. ‚úÖ Wrote comprehensive README
10. ‚úÖ Verified build (0 errors)
11. ‚úÖ Committed everything to git (3 commits)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
- [ ] Start development server and verify components work with backend
- [ ] Test WebSocket connections
- [ ] Verify health monitoring displays correctly

### Phase 2 Continued (Next 2 Weeks)
- [ ] Create `/generate` page with ContentGenerationForm
- [ ] Create `/jobs` page with JobsList
- [ ] Create `/templates` page with TemplateSelector
- [ ] Create `/settings` page for user preferences
- [ ] Implement authentication flow
- [ ] Add React Query providers

### Phase 3 (Week 6)
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel/Netlify
- [ ] Configure custom domain
- [ ] Production environment variables
- [ ] CDN and edge caching

---

## Impact on Backend Repository

### Frontend Directory Status
The `frontend/` directory in this repository can now be:
- ‚úÖ Considered deprecated (components migrated)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Kept for reference during transition
- üóëÔ∏è Removed after dashboard is deployed to production

**Recommendation**: Keep `frontend/` for now until dashboard is fully deployed and tested.

### CORS Configuration Needed
When dashboard is deployed, update backend CORS:

**File**: `src/halcytone_content_generator/main.py`

**Current**:
```python
allow_origins=["*"]  # Development
```

**Production** (update when dashboard domain known):
```python
allow_origins=[
    "https://dashboard.contentgenerator.halcytone.com",
    "http://localhost:3000",  # Local development
]
```
