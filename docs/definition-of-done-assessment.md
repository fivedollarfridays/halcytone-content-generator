---

## Critical Issues Status

### 1. AB Testing Module Failures ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue**: AB testing unit tests were failing (8 tests total)
**Impact**: Medium - Feature not critical for initial production but important for A/B testing capabilities
**Files Affected**:
- `src/halcytone_content_generator/services/ab_testing.py` ✅ Fixed
- `tests/unit/test_ab_testing.py` ✅ Fixed

**Root Cause**: Pytest collection warnings - classes named `TestVariation` and `TestMetric` were interpreted as test classes due to "Test" prefix

**Resolution Implemented**:
1. Renamed `TestVariation` → `ABTestVariation` in `ab_testing.py:70`
2. Renamed `TestMetric` → `ABTestMetric` in `ab_testing.py:82`
3. Updated all references in `ab_testing.py` (12 occurrences)
4. Updated all references in `test_ab_testing.py` (15+ occurrences)
5. Fixed typos: `ABABTestType` → `ABTestType`, `ABABTestStatus` → `ABTestStatus`

**Results**:
- ✅ All 8 AB testing unit tests now pass
- ✅ Coverage improved from 33% to 89% for AB testing module
- ✅ No pytest collection warnings

### 2. Low Test Coverage ⚠️ IMPROVING (30%, was 27%)

**Issue**: Coverage is 40% below 70% target (improved 3%)
**Impact**: Medium - Comprehensive system testing mitigates risk
**Affected**: Most API endpoints and services

**Progress Made**:
- ✅ AB Testing coverage: 33% → 89% (56% improvement)
- ✅ Overall coverage: 27% → 30% (3% improvement)
- ✅ Fixed all blocking test failures

**Recommended Action**:
- Prioritize API endpoint tests (12-31% coverage) - Phase 1
- Add service layer tests for critical business logic - Phase 2
- Focus on high-value, high-risk code paths - Phase 3
- Target: 50% coverage in next sprint, 70% in following sprint

### 3. Database Module (0% coverage)

**Issue**: Database module has 0% coverage
**Impact**: Low - Database not required for production (using external services)
**Affected**: `src/halcytone_content_generator/database/`

**Recommended Action**:
- Mark as optional feature
- Add tests if database persistence is enabled in future
