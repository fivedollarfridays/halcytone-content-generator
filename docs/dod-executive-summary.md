## Path to 70% Coverage

### Recommended Plan: 3-Week Balanced Approach

```
Week 1: Critical Foundation (42% → 52%)
├─ Days 1-2: Document Fetcher (50 tests) + Quality Scorer (60 tests)
│  └─ Expected: +3.2% coverage
└─ Days 3-4: Validation Layer (125 tests total)
   └─ Expected: +3.8% coverage
   TARGET: 49.2% (+7.0%)

Week 2: Service Layer (49% → 59%)
├─ Days 5-6: Personalization (50) + Segmentation (45)
│  └─ Expected: +2.4% coverage
└─ Days 7-8: AB Testing (50) + AI (40) + Social (45)
   └─ Expected: +3.3% coverage
   TARGET: 54.9% (+5.7%)

Week 3: API & Polish (55% → 70%)
├─ Days 9-10: API Endpoints + Health (105 tests)
│  └─ Expected: +2.0% coverage
└─ Days 11-12: Integration + Polish (170 tests)
   └─ Expected: +3.9% coverage
   TARGET: 70.8% (+15.9%)
```

### Total Effort

- **Duration**: 12-15 business days (2.5-3 weeks)
- **Tests to Add**: 705
- **Coverage Gain**: +28.6 percentage points
- **Team Size**: 1-2 developers
- **Test Rate**: 50-60 tests/day

---

## Options & Recommendations

### Option A: Aggressive (2 Weeks) ⚠️

- **Timeline**: 10 days
- **Team**: 2 developers
- **Rate**: 70-80 tests/day
- **Risk**: HIGH (quality concerns)
- **Not Recommended**

### Option B: Balanced (3 Weeks) ✅

- **Timeline**: 12-15 days
- **Team**: 1-2 developers
- **Rate**: 50-60 tests/day
- **Risk**: MEDIUM (manageable)
- **✅ RECOMMENDED**

### Option C: Conservative (4 Weeks)

- **Timeline**: 20 days
- **Team**: 1 developer
- **Rate**: 35-40 tests/day
- **Risk**: LOW (timeline delay)
- **Backup Option**

### Option D: Pragmatic Target ⚡

- **Adjust DoD to 60% coverage**
- **Timeline**: 1.5-2 weeks
- **Tests**: ~350 (not 700)
- **Focus**: Critical modules only
- **Quick Production Path**

## Immediate Actions Required

### Decision Needed (Today)

1. **Choose Timeline**:
   - [ ] Accept 3-week timeline for 70%
   - [ ] Adjust target to 60% (2 weeks)
   - [ ] Extend to 4 weeks for conservative approach

2. **Allocate Resources**:
   - [ ] Assign 1-2 developers full-time
   - [ ] Set up daily progress tracking
   - [ ] Prepare test infrastructure

3. **Approve Plan**:
   - [ ] Review detailed assessment (definition-of-done-final-assessment.md)
   - [ ] Sign off on approach
   - [ ] Authorize start

### Next Steps (Tomorrow)

**Day 1 - Setup & Start**:

2. Create reusable test patterns
3. Begin document_fetcher tests (highest priority)

**Day 2-4 - Critical Phase**:
1. Complete critical business logic tests
2. Daily coverage reports
3. Adjust priorities based on results

**Ongoing**:
1. Daily stand-ups (15 min)
2. Code reviews for all tests
3. Coverage tracking and reporting
4. Weekly progress reviews

## Risk Summary

### High Risks

1. **Timeline Pressure** ⚠️
   - 700 tests in 2-3 weeks is aggressive
   - Mitigation: Focus on highest ROI first
   - Contingency: Adjust to 65% target

2. **Test Quality** ⚠️
   - Rush may produce flaky tests
   - Mitigation: Mandatory code reviews
   - Contingency: Week 4 for stabilization

3. **Complexity** ⚠️
   - Some modules algorithmically complex
   - Mitigation: Happy paths first
   - Contingency: Accept 60% for complex modules

### Mitigation Strategy

- ✅ Phased approach with weekly milestones
- ✅ Daily progress tracking
- ✅ Strict quality gates (99%+ pass rate)
- ✅ Reusable test patterns
- ✅ Parallel test execution
- ✅ Regular stakeholder updates

---

## Success Criteria

### Must Have (Non-Negotiable)

- [ ] Overall coverage ≥ 70% (or agreed adjusted target)
- [ ] All critical modules ≥ 65%
- [ ] Test pass rate ≥ 99%
- [ ] No regressions in existing tests
- [ ] All integration tests passing

### Should Have (Important)

- [ ] Test execution < 10 minutes
- [ ] All high-priority modules ≥ 60%
- [ ] Code reviews complete
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Nice to Have (Optional)

- [ ] Branch coverage ≥ 60%
- [ ] Test suite optimizations
- [ ] Automated coverage reporting
- [ ] Test pattern documentation

---

## Bottom Line

### Current Status

🔴 **DOES NOT MEET DoD** - 42.2% coverage (need 70%)

### Recommended Action

✅ **APPROVE 3-WEEK BALANCED PLAN**

- Realistic timeline with manageable risk
- Focuses on critical business logic first
- Maintains quality standards
- Achieves 70% coverage goal

### Alternative

⚡ **ADJUST DoD TO 60%** (if timeline critical)

- Achievable in 1.5-2 weeks
- Covers all critical modules
- Faster path to production
- Still meets quality standards

### Decision Required

**Choose ONE**:
- [ ] Execute 3-week plan for 70% coverage
- [ ] Execute 2-week plan for 60% coverage
- [ ] Extend to 4 weeks for conservative approach

**Assign Resources**:
- [ ] 1 developer (slower, safer)
- [ ] 2 developers (faster, higher risk)
