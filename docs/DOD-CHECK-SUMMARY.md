## Path to 70% Coverage

### Recommended Approach (5 Phases, 18-21 Days)

**Phase 0: Test Discovery Audit** (Session 11, 2-3 hours)
- Verify tests for personalization, user_segmentation, ab_testing
- Expected: Discover 300-600 already-tested statements
- **Gain**: +2.5-5 percentage points → 43-47%

**Phase 1: High-Impact Services** (Sessions 12-14, 4-5 days)
- Complete social_publisher, ab_testing, user_segmentation
- **Gain**: +800 statements → 48-52%

**Phase 2: Infrastructure** (Sessions 15-17, 3-4 days)
- Complete content_assembler_v2, metrics, health_checks
- **Gain**: +550 statements → 53-57%

**Phase 3: API Layer** (Sessions 18-19, 3-4 days)
- Complete endpoints_schema_validated, endpoints_v2
- **Gain**: +400 statements → 57-60%

**Phase 4: V2 Clients** (Sessions 20-21, 4-5 days)
- Fix and complete crm_client_v2, platform_client_v2
- **Gain**: +500 statements → 61-64%

**Phase 5: Final Push** (Sessions 22-25, 4-6 days)
- Database layer (after Pydantic v2 migration)
- AI enhancer completion
- Remaining gaps
- **Gain**: +500-800 statements → **65-71%**

### Timeline Estimates
- **Optimistic**: 14-16 days
- **Realistic**: 18-21 days ⭐ Recommended
- **Pessimistic**: 25-30 days

## Blockers & Risks

### Active Blockers
1. **Pydantic v2 Migration** (High Priority)
   - Blocks: Database modules (~300 statements)
   - Effort: 4-6 hours
   - Recommendation: Schedule before Session 24

2. **FastAPI Request Mocking** (Medium Priority)
   - Blocks: endpoints_v2.py (~144 statements)
   - Effort: 3-4 hours
   - Recommendation: Schedule before Session 19

3. **Test Discovery Issues** (Low Priority)
   - May hide 300-600 already-tested statements
   - Effort: 2-3 hours
   - Recommendation: Address in Session 11 (Phase 0)

### Risk Mitigation
- Prioritize unblocked modules first
- Schedule blocker resolution between phases
- Maintain test quality over quantity
- Document "good enough" thresholds

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)
1. **Execute Phase 0** (Session 11): Test discovery audit
   - Run targeted tests for claimed-complete modules
   - May discover 300-600 statements
   - Update baseline coverage

2. **Begin Phase 1** (Session 12): social_publisher.py
   - Highest impact single module (225 statements to 70%)
   - Clear test strategy available
   - 3-4 hour session

### Strategic Recommendations

**Do**:
- ✅ Follow the 5-phase plan systematically
- ✅ Verify coverage after each session
- ✅ Focus on one module per session
- ✅ Address blockers between phases
- ✅ Maintain documentation

**Don't**:
- ❌ Run full test suite (use targeted runs)
- ❌ Let perfect be the enemy of good
- ❌ Skip coverage verification
- ❌ Create tests without clear objectives
- ❌ Ignore established patterns

### Success Criteria for Next Review

**Coverage Targets**:
- [ ] Phase 0 complete: 43-47% verified
- [ ] Phase 1 complete: 48-52%
- [ ] Phase 2 complete: 53-57%
- [ ] Phase 3 complete: 57-60%
- [ ] **Final Target**: ≥70%

**Quality Targets**:
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No critical module <50%
- [ ] Blockers resolved
- [ ] Test suite <10 minutes

## Conclusion

### Current Status: STRONG PROGRESS, DoD NOT MET

**Achievements**:
- Went from 13.3% to 41-42% coverage (+28 points)
- Created ~1,700 high-quality tests
- Established solid testing patterns
- Core infrastructure near-perfectly tested

**Remaining Work**:
- 28-29 percentage points to 70% target
- 3,423 statements need coverage
- 18-21 days estimated (realistic timeline)
- Clear, systematic path forward

**Confidence Level**: HIGH ✓

The path to 70% is:
- ✅ Well-defined (5 phases)
- ✅ Realistic (18-21 days)
- ✅ Achievable (proven velocity)
- ✅ Systematic (phase-based approach)

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Phase 0 (Test Discovery Audit) in next session to potentially gain 300-600 statements through better test discovery, then systematically execute Phases 1-5 per the ACTION-PLAN.

**Assessment Complete** ✓
**Next Action**: Execute Phase 0 (Session 11) - Test Discovery Audit
**Expected Outcome**: Updated baseline at 43-47% coverage, clear path forward confirmed
