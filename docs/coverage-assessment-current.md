## Risk Assessment

### High Risks

1. **Timeline Risk**: 2-3 weeks for 560-700 tests is aggressive
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on high-ROI modules first, extend if needed
   - **Contingency**: Adjust target to 65% if timeline constrained

2. **Test Complexity**: Some modules (quality scorer, AI enhancer) are algorithmically complex
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on happy paths first, edge cases second
   - **Contingency**: Accept lower coverage (60%) for complex modules

### Medium Risks

3. **Test Execution Time**: Suite may slow down with 700 new tests
   - **Mitigation**: Optimize slow tests, use parallel execution
   - **Contingency**: Implement test markers for selective execution

4. **Mock Complexity**: External service mocking can be brittle
   - **Mitigation**: Create reusable mock fixtures
   - **Contingency**: Use integration tests where mocking is too complex

### Low Risks

5. **Coverage Plateau**: May hit diminishing returns around 68-69%
   - **Mitigation**: Review uncovered code for dead code
   - **Contingency**: Accept 68-70% as target range

---

## Resource Requirements

### Estimated Effort

**Option A - Aggressive (2 weeks, 2 developers)**
- Parallel test development
- Risk: Lower test quality
- Outcome: 70% in 2 weeks

**Option B - Balanced (3 weeks, 1-2 developers)** ✅ RECOMMENDED
- Sequential phases with reviews
- Risk: Manageable timeline pressure
- Outcome: 70% in 3 weeks

**Option C - Conservative (4 weeks, 1 developer)**
- Methodical test development
- Risk: Delayed completion
- Outcome: 70% in 4 weeks

### Test Production Rate

- **Required Rate**: 40-60 tests/day
- **Achievable Rate**: 30-50 tests/day (based on current velocity)
- **Team Capacity**: 4-5 hours/day of focused test development

---

## Conclusion

### Current State

- **Coverage**: 42.2% (27.8 points below target)
- **Effective Coverage**: 47.5% (excluding unused infrastructure)
- **Tests**: 1,585 total (integration tests passing well)
- **Production Ready**: Yes (comprehensive integration coverage)
- **Meets DoD**: ❌ NO - Requires 560-700 additional tests

### Recommended Path Forward

1. **Accept 3-week timeline** for 70% coverage
2. **Focus on critical business logic first** (Phase 1)
3. **Use phased approach** with weekly milestones
4. **Maintain test quality** over speed (99%+ pass rate)
5. **Review progress weekly** and adjust as needed

### Alternative: Pragmatic DoD Adjustment

If 3 weeks is too long or resources are constrained:
- **60% overall coverage** (achievable in 1.5-2 weeks)
- **Critical modules ≥ 60%**
- **All integration tests passing**
- **Production-critical paths fully covered**

This would meet most quality gates while being more realistic given the production readiness timeline.

**Assessment Status**: COMPLETE
**Next Step**: Begin Phase 1 - Critical Business Logic
**Next Review**: End of Week 1 (Day 4)
**Target Completion**: 70% coverage in 2-3 weeks
