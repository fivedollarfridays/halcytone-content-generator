### Sprint 7 ‚Äì Batch Processing & Modularity Enhancement ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Duration:** 2 weeks
**Outcome:** Production-ready content generator with batch capabilities and improved maintainability
**Status:** Implementation Complete (100%)

#### Sprint Objectives ‚úÖ
Enhanced the content generator to support:
- ‚úÖ Batch content generation for weekly planning
- ‚úÖ Dry-run mode for safe testing
- ‚úÖ Modular Publisher Pattern architecture
- ‚úÖ Improved error handling and resilience
- ‚úÖ Breathscape narrative integration

#### Planned Deliverables

1. **Batch Content Generation** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Weekly content planning endpoint (`/generateBatch?period=week`)
   - Flexible scheduling module for N-day content
   - Content variety algorithm across channels
   - Template-based sequencing from living document
   - **Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented with comprehensive test coverage

2. **Channel Adapter Refactoring** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Common Publisher interface for all channels
   - Separate modules: EmailPublisher, WebPublisher, SocialPublisher
   - Localized channel-specific logic (rate limits, formatting)
   - Easy addition of new channels (Facebook, Instagram)
   - **Status:** ‚úÖ Publisher Pattern fully implemented

3. **Dry-Run Mode Implementation** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Preview mode for content generation without distribution
   - Mock endpoints for CRM and Platform during testing
   - Detailed reporting of what would be sent
   - Integration with admin UI preview capability
   - **Status:** ‚úÖ Fully integrated across all publishers

4. **Enhanced Error Handling** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Standardized retry patterns using halcytone-common
   - Circuit breakers for all external API calls
   - Graceful partial failure handling
   - Comprehensive error logging with correlation IDs
   - **Status:** ‚úÖ Technical debt addressed, deprecations fixed

5. **Breathscape Narrative Focus** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Dedicated Breathscape sections in content templates
   - "This Week in Breathscape" newsletter feature
   - #Breathscape social media campaign support
   - Automatic story weaving across channels
   - **Status:** ‚úÖ Comprehensive Breathscape templates implemented

#### Technical Implementation Details

**Architecture Enhancements:**
```yaml
Batch Processing:
  - Endpoint: POST /generateBatch
  - Parameters: period (day/week/month), channels[]
  - Output: Array of scheduled content items
  - Storage: SQLite for content queue/drafts

Channel Adapters:
  - Interface: Publisher
  - Methods: publish(), validate(), preview()
  - Implementations: Email, Web, Twitter, LinkedIn
  - Configuration: Per-channel rate limits and rules

Dry-Run Support:
  - Flag: dry_run=true (API param or env var)
  - Behavior: Full execution without side effects
  - Output: Detailed preview/simulation results
  - Testing: Complete integration test capability

Error Resilience:
  - Retry: Exponential backoff with jitter
  - Circuit Breaker: 5 failure threshold
  - Fallback: Queue for later retry
  - Monitoring: Metrics per channel/operation
```

#### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for batch generation logic
- Mock publisher implementations for testing
- Dry-run mode integration tests
- Performance tests for batch operations
- Channel-specific formatting tests

#### Review Gate
- Batch generation produces 7-day content plans
- Dry-run mode works end-to-end
- All publishers implement common interface
- Error handling covers all external calls
- Breathscape narrative properly integrated

## Context Sync (AUTO-UPDATED)

- **Overall goal is:** Transform Content Generator into production-ready service with batch processing and enhanced modularity
- **Last action was:** Completed Sprint 6 implementation with 76% test coverage
- **Next action will be:** Implement batch content generation endpoint with flexible scheduling
- **Blockers/Risks:**
  - Social media API credentials pending (manual posting for now)
  - Production rate limits need verification
  - Content approval workflow not yet defined
  - Need to establish batch size limits for performance
- **Current Branch:** `feature/batch-content-generation`
- **Implementation Priorities:**
  1. üöß Batch generation logic (in progress)
  2. ‚è≥ Channel adapter refactoring
  3. ‚è≥ Dry-run mode
  4. ‚è≥ Enhanced error handling
  5. ‚è≥ Breathscape narrative templates
