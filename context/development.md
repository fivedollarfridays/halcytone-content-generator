### Sprint 6 – Content Generator & Ecosystem Launch ✅ COMPLETED
**Duration:** 3 weeks
**Outcome:** Automated content generation for multi-channel communications, full ecosystem production readiness
**Status:** Implementation Complete (100%)

#### Sprint Objectives
Transform marketing communications through automated content generation that:
- Creates email newsletters via CRM integration
- Publishes website updates automatically
- Generates social media content drafts
- Maintains consistent messaging across all channels
- Leverages existing microservice architecture

#### Planned Deliverables

1. **Content Generator Service** ✅
   - New Python/FastAPI microservice following platform patterns
   - Integration with "living document" source (Google Docs/Notion/Internal CMS)
   - Multi-channel content assembly (email, web, social)
   - Template-based content generation with personalization support
   - Status: ✅ Completed (main.py, v1/v2 API endpoints)

2. **CRM Email Integration** ✅
   - Newsletter endpoint in CRM Worker (`POST /api/v1/notifications/newsletter`)
   - Bulk email distribution using existing EmailNotificationService
   - API key authentication for service-to-service communication
   - Email template management and logging
   - Status: ✅ Completed (crm_client_v2.py with bulk email, analytics, auth)

3. **Website Content Publishing** ✅
   - New `updates` table in Platform PostgreSQL
   - Admin API endpoint (`POST /api/v1/updates`) for content publishing
   - Next.js frontend updates page/blog section
   - Auto-publication of generated content
   - Status: ✅ Completed (platform_client_v2.py with versioning, monitoring)

4. **Living Document System** ✅
   - Structured content source setup (sections for Breathscape, Hardware, Tips, Vision)
   - API integration for document retrieval (Google Docs/Notion API)
   - Content parsing and categorization logic
   - Version tracking and change detection
   - Status: ✅ Completed (document_fetcher.py with multiple parsing strategies)

5. **Service Integration Patterns** ✅
   - API contracts with CRM for recipient lists
   - Platform API integration for usage statistics
   - Correlation ID propagation for tracing
   - Circuit breakers and retry logic (reusing Sprint 3 patterns)
   - Status: ✅ Completed (content_sync.py, monitoring.py, full telemetry)

#### Technical Implementation Details

**Architecture Decisions:**
```yaml
Service Design:
  - Type: Microservice (separate from Platform API)
  - Language: Python with FastAPI
  - Database: None initially (stateless) or SQLite for content logs
  - Authentication: API keys for service-to-service
  - Deployment: Container/Lambda based on processing needs

Integration Points:
  - CRM API: Fetch users/leads, send newsletters
  - Platform API: Publish website updates, get statistics
  - Living Document: Google Docs/Notion API or internal CMS
  - Social Platforms: Manual initially, API automation later

Content Flow:
  1. Fetch content from living document
  2. Assemble multi-channel outputs
  3. Send email via CRM
  4. Publish to website via Platform API
  5. Generate social snippets for review
```

#### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for content assembly logic
- Integration tests with mock services
- End-to-end testing in staging environment
- Email delivery verification
- Content quality review process

#### Review Gate
- Content generator produces consistent multi-channel output
- Email distribution via CRM successful in staging
- Website updates published automatically
- Living document integration operational
- All services maintain existing SLAs

#### Definition of Done
- [x] Content generator service deployed and operational
- [x] CRM newsletter endpoint implemented and tested
- [x] Website updates API and UI complete
- [x] Living document integrated as content source
- [x] Service-to-service authentication configured
- [x] End-to-end content generation tested
- [x] Documentation updated for new workflows
- [x] Test coverage increased to 76% (approaching 80% target)
- [ ] First production newsletter successfully sent (pending production deployment)
